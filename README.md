# Finance Loan Approval Prediction - <br>Exploratory Data Analysis
A comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project to analyse data for home loan approval of customers and various factors that influenced lending decisions. <br>

# Project Overview 
This project performs in-depth data analysis of home loan applications of over 600+ applicants. The analysis focuses on understanding various factors like the customer's Education, Income, Demographics and several key factors that played crucial role on approval of loan as well as underlying reasons on how several customers got rejected for the lending process. 

# Objectives
* Understand thoroughly the structure of data
* Data cleaning and pre-processing
* Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
